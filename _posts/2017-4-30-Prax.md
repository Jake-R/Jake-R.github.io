Often times in Capture the Flag competitions you'll be expected to pass arguments or input to a program to overflow a buffer. Usually the goal is to overwrite a return address in memory to get the program to jump and crash, then backtrack and figure out where what string you should input to jump to another section of the executable. The way I have seen this done is either with printf or with python:

~~~
>> printf 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\x12\x34\x56\x78' | ./some_binary
>> python -c '"A"*12 + "\x12\x34\x56\x78"' | ./some_binary
~~~

more than a couple "A"s and "\\x"s and I'm pooped, not to mention sometimes you'll have to swap the endianness of the bytes so imagine my delight when I find out about rax2, the conversion utility that comes with Radare2:
 ~~~
#Swap endianness and output hex
>> rax2 -ke 0xcafebabe
0xbebafeca
#Cool! let try another
>> rax2 -ke 0xdeadbeef
Fx4f5eadbf
#...wut
 ~~~

It turns out the rax2 believes that hex values are floats if they end in a lowercase 'f', despite rax2 printing all its hex in lowercase. that's okay, we can work around that, right?
~~~
#output raw bytes (piped to xxd for clarity).
>> rax2 -s 0xdeadbeeF |xxd
00000000: dead beef
#Sweet! Let's go again!
>> rax2 -es 0xdeadbeeF |xxd
00000000: dead beef
#oh :( ...swapping endianness doesn't work if you want to output raw bytes
~~~
We can make this work though:
~~~
>> rax2 -ke 0xdeadbeeF | rax2 -s | xxd
00000000: efbe adde                                ....
#Great! Give us another one!!!
>> rax2 -ke 0xefbeadde | rax2 -s | xxd
00000000: dead beef
#oh it actually worked that time...this is so embarrassing
~~~
Consistent in its inconsistency, rax2 works fine when piped a value that ends in 'f' because it checks only the last character (\n in this case). Sorry if you had a float you wanted to pipe in I guess. Rax2 is full of short-circuits and inconsistent behaviour that would drive anyone mad.


Enough whining? okay. [Prax](http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0566106/) tries to be a flexible and easy replacement that behaves consistently and gets out of your way. By default, Prax mirrors the '?' command in r2 and prints all the permuatations of the input that it can.
~~~
>> prax 0xdeadbeef
0xdeadbeef 3735928559 ޭ�� 3q2+7w==

#swap endianness
>> prax -e 0xdeadbeef
0xefbeadde 4022250974 ﾭ� 776t3g==
~~~
We can choose specific output and input formats using lowercase and uppercase flags, respectively.

| Flag | Type |
| ---- | ---- |
| x/X | Hexadecimal |
| d/D | Decimal |
| o/O | Octal |
| r/R | Raw (ascii) |
| s\S | Base-64 |

We can also lose the newline with '-n' in case it would impact the program we are piping to
~~~
>> prax -rn 0xdeadbeef
��>>
~~~

This is nice and all, but it still doesn't help with the scenario where we need a specific length buffer. Prax has a parser that tries to make generating various inputs easy. To repeat our printf/python example at the top, we can just do this:
~~~
>> prax -r A*12+0x12345678
AAAAAAAAAAAA4Vx
#xxd: 00000000: 4141 4141 4141 4141 4141 4141 1234 5678
~~~
Additionally, we can easily make a series by using the '@' symbol:
~~~
>> prax -x 0x10@20
0x101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f
>> prax -r A@26
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
~~~

So anyway, try it out and find all the bugs! It is available on pypi:
~~~
>> sudo -H pip install prax
~~~
